            <p>More than 75% of New York City subway stations are inaccessible. That's more than 354 of 472 stations.</p>
            <p>I've lived in N.Y.C. for over three years, and I haven't taken the subway once. I can't assume there is an elevator at every subway stop for me to get on and off, and I don't want to take the risk of getting stuck somewhere underground. Everyone complains about how much they hate the subway&mdash;I would probably hate it too&mdash;but I don’t should have the option to decide that for myself.</p>
            <p>As I've lived here, I've noticed that restaurants, stores, apartment buildings&mdash;name another type of place people go&mdash;are completely inaccessible. I can go on Yelp and see if it's accessible, but based on my experiences, an ignorant, able-bodied person tags those places. <i>Sure, it's great to have an elevator, but if I have to get up stairs to get to the elevator, it's not actually accessible.</i></p>
            <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 has been law since 1990&mdash;why haven't <a href="https://www.instagram.com/INACCESSIBLEEARTH/">these places</a> been updated in that time?! </p>
            <p>I have yet to find a list that calls out inaccessible places, so I'm starting one&mdash;follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/INACCESSIBLEEARTH/">@inaccessibleearth</a> for the list.</p>
            <p>I designed this sign to call out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/INACCESSIBLEEARTH/">these inaccessible places</a>.</p>
            <p>If you know an inaccessible place and want to put a sign up, <a href="mailto:inaccessibbleearth@gmail.com">email me</a>. I'll send one to you. All I ask in return is that you please send me a picture of the posted sign and tell me its location.</p>
            <p>If you don’’t want to put a sign up, but still want to help, <a href="mailto:inaccessibleearth@gmail.com">email me</a> a photo of the inaccessible place and it’s address, and I'll add it to @inaccessibleearth.</p>
